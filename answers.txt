What is a repository ? and how is it diff from a branch ?
Ans:- A repository is your whole project (directories and files) that you clone on your computer. A branch is a version of your repository, or in other words, an independent line of development. A repository can contain multiple branches, which means there are multiple versions of the repository.



What is the difference between rebase and git merge ?
Ans:- Both git merge and git rebase are used to merge branches. There is one difference between them. The difference lies in the commit history after you integrate one branch into another.

Suppose developer A made a commit and developer B made another commit.

git merge:

After merging, commits from both the developers will be there in git log. This is really good for beginners cause the head can be rolled back to commit from either developer A or developer B.

git rebase:

After rebasing, commit from only one developer will be stamped in git log. Advanced developers prefer this cause it makes the commit history linear and clean.

What is Git Squash ?
Ans:- In Git, the term squash is used to squash the previous commits into one. It is not a command; instead, it is a keyword. The squash is an excellent technique for group-specific changes before forwarding them to others. You can merge several commits into a single commit with the compelling interactive rebase command.

What is cherrypicking?
Ans:- Cherry picking is the act of picking a commit from a branch and applying it to another. git cherry-pick can be useful for undoing changes. For example, say a commit is accidently made to the wrong branch. You can switch to the correct branch and cherry-pick the commit to where it should belong.
